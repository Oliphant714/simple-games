    "intro" : "You arrive at the castle, but the drawbridge has yet to be lowered for you.\nA rude gesture, as a wizard of your import, who had been summoned here no less, should have been given an escort to the finest rooms of the castle.\nAs you sit and ponder this insulting move, sounds of steel clashing against steel begin to reach your ears.\nA battle is taking place within the courtyard!\nMaybe this was not so rude after all, but an inability to act.\nWhat do you choose to do?\nCast KNOCK on the drawbridge to lower it?\nCast JUMP and leap over the wall?\nOr do you LEAVE the castle to its fate?",
    "knock" : "Raising your staff high above your head, the tip thereof glowing a deep maroon, you cry the magic words aloud as you feel your spell take shape.\nWith a brilliant flash, the chains begin to rattle and the bridge begins its slow descent, sounds of metal blade on metal blade still ringing through the night.\nAs the bridge crashes to the ground before you, you can now see the knights of the castle waging a losing war against a legion of spirit warriors!\nQuick, what do you do now?  Cast SLEEP and quell the fighting?\nCast FIREBALL and end the conflict, once and for all?\nOr do you LEAVE the castle before those angry ghosts discover you?  ",
    "jump" : "With a quick word, you touch your staff to the ground, green energy sparking.\nYou feel your feet grow in power and strength, with energy running up your legs and into your torso.\nWith a mighty bound, you clear the moat and land on a block of stone, slightly protruding from the side of the wall.\nTaking but a moment to gather your strength, you leap up into the sky, your momentum carrying you high above the battlements!\nThere, high in the sky, you can see the knights of the castle waging a losing war against a legion of spirit warriors!\nQuick, what do you do now?\nCast LIGHTNING and cause the sky to fight for you?\nCast BANISH and attempt to quell the fighting?\nOr do you let your momentum carry you back down to the ground and LEAVE?  ",
    "sleep" : "Mumbling magic mutterings of sweet nothings, you sweep your staff before you, soft lines of pale blue glowing along its length.\nA glittering, sparkling dust issues forth, quickly becoming a cloud which swallows the castle whole.\nAs the dust settles, you can see the peacefully sleeping bodies of perhaps three-score soldiers, with twice as many spirits slowly sinking into the ground.\nWith the castle liberated, you turn around and head back home, satisfied in a job well done.\nAs you journey, you wonder if you said the words correctly.  Was it ‘with a good night’s kiss you sleep?’ or ‘until a good knight’s kiss, you sleep?’\nOh well.  Either way they might sleep a hundred years.\nThe Wizard Guild will not like this at all.  Oh the paperwork!",
    "fireball" : "Raising your voice to an impossible volume, the magic phrase flies out of your mouth as your staff begins to glow with a pulsating, golden light.\nPouring energy into your spell, a single mote of bright fire leaps from the tip of your staff.\nIt arcs through the sky into the center of the courtyard.\nAs the spot of light flutters through the air, soldiers and spirits alike pause to watch the progress of the tiny sun, blissfully unaware of the power of the spell you have just cast. \nAs the spell hits the ground in the center of all the fighting, now paused, the light ruptures and, with a sound like the earth being torn asunder, a wall of fire erupts hundreds of feet into the sky!  It expands rapidly, rushing through the courtyard and walls alike!\nJets of flame burst from arrow slits and, as the flame begins to rush across the drawbridge, you wonder if you might have overdone it.\nWith a wall of flame rushing towards you, you can only close your eyes and feel the blistering warmth.\nThen, in a blink, the fire disappears, just inches before you.\nOpening your eyes, you begin to take inventory of yourself and discover, to your immortal shame, you shall have to discover the magical secret of regrowing your own eyebrows.",
    "lightning" : "Swinging your staff in circles around your body, the air begins to swirl, creating great clouds full of magical power.\nHeld aloft in the air by your magical storm, you begin to direct your magic to strike the combatants below.  With deafening cracks of thunder, the sky is torn apart by brilliant flashes of yellow and blue lightning!\nThe deadly bolts of electricity begin to strike the attacking spirits with merciless precision.\nStrike, one spirit gone.  Strike, another spirit gone.  Strike, another spir… oops.  That was a soldier.\nOh well.\nWith several dozen more strikes of lightning, your storm finally abates, with you landing softly on the ground in the middle of the courtyard.\nThe surviving soldiers are all pressed against the walls, in obvious fear and awe of your great power.\nCloak billowing behind you, you jump back over the wall, grinning from ear to ear, the rush of their admiration flowing through you.\nStorm magic has always been your favorite.",
    "banish" : "Pointing your staff before you, you hurtle to the ground like a human meteor.\nWith a cry, and a burst of violet light, you land and expel a wave of purple energy, rushing out like a horde of rampaging bulls!\nAs the wave passes through the courtyard, the soldiers all stumble as the spirits they were facing suddenly disappear, banished back to the plane of death to await judgment for escaping the bonds of eternity.\nAs you walk through the courtyard, the soldiers begin cheering for you, some collapsing to their knees with heartfelt prayers of gratitude.\nYou feel a surge of pride and recognize that you have just saved the lives of these men and they will forever be in your debt.\nWith a casual smile, you vault back over the wall, and disappear into the night.",
    "bell" : "With a slight chuckle, understanding dawns upon you as you realize why you, specifically, were summoned.\nPulling a small, silver bell from your pocket, you tap it once against your staff.\nA single, hollow chime fills the sky, the note chilling you to the bone.\nAll as one, the spirits cease their fighting and begin to claw at the ground and air, desperate for anything to hold on to, as their essences are vacuumed into the bell in your hand.\nLaughing now, you harness the power within the bell to open a portal back to your sanctum.\nQuickly moving through, you emerge back home.\nYou place bell in the middle of the pentagram on the floor and, with a word, release the spirits into the inscribed circle\n A few key words binds the phantoms to your service.\nYou flick your wrist and they all descend through the floor to a vast cavern below, filled with legions of the undead; an army built with a single purpose, the conquering of the whole world.\nBeginning soft, then gradually climbing in volume, your dark laughter echoes through the halls, a sound of joy to you and a sound of impending doom to those who would dare oppose you.",

    "intro" : "Walking into town, you draw a number of odd looks, but that is to be expected.\nAfter all, how many other people dress in full armor and carry an enchanted war axe?\nYou spy a town notice board and walk towards it, eyeing the listings.\nMost of it is just the usual dribble; meetings, criminal execution dates, and town gossip; but two notices stand out at you.\nRather large bounties have been placed on two creatures that apparently have been ravaging this town, a DRAGON and a GIANT.\nEither would be a worthy test of your abilities.\nWhich do you decide to go after?\nOr do you instead decide to LEAVE town and look elsewhere?  ",
    "dragon" : "Following tips from local townsfolk and a trail of blackened trees, you find yourself at the mouth of a large cave.\nUnslinging your axe, you begin to make your way carefully down the slippery slope, trusting in your enchanted armor to not slip.\nAs the light begins to fall behind you, heat signatures begin to emerge into view, allowing you to see the great dragon in all its glory, asleep upon a mound of gold.\nQuickly assessing the situation, and not wanting to lose your advantage of an unconscious opponent, you decide on a plan of action.\nDo you RUSH in and strike the dread creature?\nDo you THROW your axe, hoping to imbed it deep in the dragon?\nOr do you LEAVE and let the townspeople deal with the dragon on their own?   ",
    "giant" : "After a brief search, you find the site of the latest attack by the monstrous brute.\nWith footprints wide as a swine, you have no problem tracking it.\nFollowing the trail, you are lead deep into the woods where the trees grow far taller than normal.\nWeaving around trees and dodging rodents of unusual sizes, you finally see your prey before you.\nA mountain of muscle, the giant wears naught but a loincloth and carries a crude, wooden cudgel.\nYou tread carefully, attempting to catch it from behind.\nA twig breaks underfoot and the giant snaps around.\nSeeing you, his monstrous face breaks out in a smile wide enough to swallow a knight, horse and all!\nWith a loud roar, he charges you, cudgel held high over head!\nQuick!  What do you do?\nGo for the ANKLES?  CLIMB a tree?\nOr flee the fight and LEAVE the townsfolk to the mercy of this monstrosity?   ",
    "rush" : "With a mighty bellow, you charge into the cavern, magical boots keeping your footing steady.\nThe dragon’s eyes suddenly snap open and it opens its mouth toward you, spewing forth a wave of orange flame!\nThrowing your hand in front of your eyes, you charge through the fountain of fire, putting full confidence in your magic armor.\nUpon exiting the flame, you swing your axe up and strike the dragon’s jaw.\nWith a roar of pain, the dragon rears back before extending one claw to crush you!\nSwinging your axe again, you begin to become a whirlwind of steel and death.\nAs dragon's claws fall towards you, they are suddenly severed from their hand by your blade, still moving.\nWith a roar of outrage, the dragon moves in, hoping to bite quickly and end the battle.\nNever one to pass up an opportunity, you deftly sidestep and your legendary axe quickly frees the dragon’s head from its miserable shoulders.\nHeaving a sigh of satisfaction, you grab the head by one of the horns and begin to drag it from the cave.\nThe warm sunlight reaches your face.\nYou smile, thinking about how you will spend your reward money.  ",
    "throw" : "Adjusting your grip and hefting the mighty axe over your head, you hurl your famed weapon at the heart of the dragon.\nThe blade buries itself deep in the chest of the great beast, biting deeply.\nEyes snapping open, the dragon roars in anger, promptly attempting to charge at you.\nAs someone not yet ready to die, you hold your hand out in front of you, palm outward.\nThe enchantment in your axe responds to the call and the legendary weapon tears itself free from its hide-bound prison, rushing through the air and into your awaiting grip.\nWith blood flowing freely from its chest, the dragon stumbles and slips down the pile of gold, a cacophony of sound accosting your ears.\nYou throw your axe again, this time aiming for the great beast’s head.\nWith the precision and accuracy only a master can achieve, the axe sails into the head of the dragon and then out the other side, neatly penetrating both golden eyeballs.\nWith hardly another sound, the dragon collapses to the ground, permanently defeated.\nMaking your way down to the dragon’s corpse, you can’t help but notice all the gold lying around.\nSurely it must belong to somebody now that its previous owner is no more.\nWell, you reason that you must do the right thing and give it all a new owner.\nAnd what better owner could there be than yourself?\nYou smile as you imagine your future; a life of luxury.  ",
    "ankles" : "Moving fast as a snake, you charge forward and swing your great axe at the unprotected space between foot and leg.\nYour axe biting deep, a howling sound comes from above you and the mighty giant begins to fall to the ground.\nLeaving your axe embedded in the flesh of the giant, you dive out from under the falling monster.\nWith a roar of anger, the brute rolls to face you, putting his face between you and your axe.\nA big mistake.  Smiling, you hold your hand out and the magic within the axe responds to your call, summoning the weapon to your hand by the shortest route possible.\nRocketing out from the giant’s ankle, tearing chunks of flesh in the process, the axe hurtles towards your outstretched fingers.\nEntering the giant’s neck at the base of the skull, it exits from in between the lips of the, now incredibly surprised, face of the giant.\nAs the last wisps of air escape the lungs of the nearly decapitated brute, you walk forward and begin to wipe your blade off on your opponent’s loincloth.\nYour work here is done.\n  Now, how are you going to get the corpse back to town to claim the bounty?

    "climb" : "Thinking quickly, you turn and vault into the lower branches of the tree behind you.\nJumping from branch to branch, you quickly climb to the point where you are level with the giant’s head.\nThe stupid brute, confused and trying to follow you with his eyes, continues his rush forward and slams full throttle into the tree.\nStaggering back, he falls to the ground.\nThe tree shuddering beneath you, you fall as well.\nHowever, unlike your opponent, you do so with purpose.\nCurling into a ball, you turn yourself into a human projectile of hard metal.\nSlamming down into the chest of the giant, you feel several things crack beneath you and the giant roars, eyes rolling back in his head.\nStanding up, you once again pull out your axe, jump off the body of the giant, and deliver a blow that would make any executioner proud.\nPushing the head away from the corpse, you begin rolling it back through the woods.\nSurely no one can doubt this great accomplishment.\nBut what happened to all the treasure the giant carried off, you wonder.\nAnother quest for another day.  ",
    "pray" : "Falling to your knees, you offer up all the prayers of the townspeople.\nIn a few words of your own, you express the desperation, need, and hopes that currently rest on your shoulders.\nA bright light suddenly explodes against your closed eyelids.\nYou open your eyes to see your opponent roaring at a swirling light up above you.\nSuddenly, luminous chains streak down out of the light and begin to bind arms, legs, and body of the monster before you.\nYou watch as it is slowly dragged, roaring and fighting, into the swirling vortex above you.\nSuddenly, as quickly as it came, the light is gone.\nA misshapen lump falls to the ground.\nYou hurry over and find one leg from your opponent, severed from its original owner.\nA trophy, you realize, to prove your victory this day.\nDetermined to remember this divine intervention, you set out, a champion for a holy power.

Hundreds of potential enemies.  Millions of worthwhile reasons.\nHowever, you must now decide your target.\nThere are two possible places you could find what you’re looking for; the royal CASTLE or the city PRISON.\nYou could also LEAVE the city and let whatever happens happen.\nWhat shall you do?

    "castle" : "Vaulting from rooftop to rooftop, you silently prowl across the city.\nThe thrill of the hunt begins to swell within you and you find yourself before the outer wall of the palace.\nStopping for not a second, you draw your daggers from your belt, the dark blades seeming to soak in what little light there is.\nYou fling yourself at the wall, stabbing your blades into the rock.\nSwiftly you begin your ascent, stabbing each blade into the stone, creating a ladder of sorts for yourself.\nAfter a swift ascent, you alight over the edge of the battlement and slide down the wall on the other side.\nYou have successfully broken into a place that was said to be unbreachable.\nYeah.  You’ve heard that one before.\nDashing quickly through a window, you begin to creep along the halls.\nYou reach a fork in the passage.\nDo you head to the King’s royal CHAMBER?  Or sneak into the DUNGEONS?\nThen there is the possibility of abandoning this dangerous mission, you could LEAVE.\nWhat do you do?  ",
    "prison" : "You quickly vault a few more rooftops before sliding down the wooden wall of the garrison.\nWhy must the garrison always be so close to the prison?\nMoving quickly and silently, using the movement of the clouds to cover your progression, you creep across the street to the back of the prison.\nQuickly swinging yourself through a window, you find yourself surrounded by Royal Enforcers!\nOne of them grabs you while the others all ready their weapons, each sure that you will not escape this time.  Smiling, your free hand drops to your belt.\nWhat do you grab?  A spark BOMB?  Maybe the tin WHISTLE?  Or do you knife the hand holding you and LEAVE the scene?   ",

    "dungeons" : "As you creep down the passages, you duck into shaded alcoves only twice to avoid soldier patrols.\nUpon finding the stairs down, you take them two at a time, stepping lightly on the balls of your feet for maximum silence.\nUpon reaching the dungeons you see the jailers; one a shrimpy, pale little thing and the other a grossly overweight man with breath that could stun a horse; both slumped unconscious on a table, empty ale mugs set before them.\nYou move along the cells, swift as a shadow, until you find the one you’re looking for.\nThere, sitting upright and regal as ever, is the princess and rightful heir to the throne.\nShe gives you one look and then a grand smile breaks out upon her face.\nYou swiftly pull a set of picks from your pocket and have the cell door open in a few seconds.\nThe princess walks out of her cell and, understanding the need for silence, follows your silent gait, her footsteps hushed.\nTurning a corner you reach a brick wall.\nLooking at the princess you place your hand on one of the bricks.\nShe gives you a curt and royal nod, to which you promptly pull the block out, turn it around and place it back in.\nWith a low rumble, a section of the wall slides away revealing a narrow passage.\nYou rush the princess into the tunnel and then follow suit, making sure to seal the passage behind you.\nAs you run down the passage, princess at your side, you realize that now, and only now, is there a chance for the return of the rightful rulers of the kingdom.
